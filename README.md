## üìñ About <a name = "about"></a>

It's just a basic morse code translator, which will translate on each key press, and will work on each own both ways, no buttons needed.

## üìù Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Everything needed is just going to the page and you can start typing in the top or left(in landscape mode). Theme is dependent from the browser theme, so if you prefer it dark/light - it will change with changing the browser's theme.

## üõ† Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

- Type either text (English or Polish) and you will get in the output box the morse code with each letter you write.
- When typing text into the input field, play buttons will appear on the left bottom corners of text boxes, press either of them - the input text's one is based on the device's sound using <a href = "https://github.com/netAction/morseSynth">this repo</a> as a base - it will play faster, the output text's one is based on the audio files(which might act funny on Safari when using headphones and on iOS in general - it's really slow).
- If you want to copy the output, just click on the copy text button, and everything from the output box will be copied to your clipboard, ready to paste anywhere.
- If you want to translate from Morse Code, just start typing, dit is ., dah is -, break between letters is one space, break between words is space / space (" / ").
- Theme can be changed by changing your default theme of the browser.
- Layout will change automatically when in landscape mode.
